It promotes code reusability and enables the creation of specialized classes based on existing ones. It forms a hierarchy of classes where derived classes inherit characteristics from their base (parent) classes.\n",

        "# Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms or have multiple behaviors. Polymorphism enables the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects, improving code flexibility and extensibility.\n",

        "# Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on the essential features of an object or system, while hiding unnecessary details. It simplifies complex systems by providing a simplified interface. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, making code more modular, and improving code understandability and maintainability.\n"
